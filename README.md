# Slided
Slided is a questionable quality tool I made in order to reinvent the wheel. In this case, the wheel is slideshow desktop wallpapers.

## How to use
1. Put some wallpaper images into ~/.wallpaper
2.
```
slided [INTERVAL IN SECONDS (default 600)]
```

## Support
X11 - Works great using feh as a backend.

Wayland (WLR) - ??? using swaybg as a backend
